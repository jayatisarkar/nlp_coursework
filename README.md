## Notebooks

* `nlpcw_keras.ipynb` - Contains the methods to convert the input sentences into word embeddings. Additionally, contains all the deep neural networks that we implemented using Keras.
* `statistical_regressors.ipynb` - Contains the implementation of the different statistical regressors that were tested using **sklearn** and **GloVe** word embeddings.
* `word2vec_preprocessing.ipynb` - Contains preprocessing of the dataset including removing punctuation and numbers from sentences to increase embedding coverage.
